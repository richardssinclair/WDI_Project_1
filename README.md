This is the first project I made for my web development immersive course at General Assembly. 

After two weeks of learning Javascript, I created a simple hangman game themed on music lyrics, the missing words are picked at random so the game is always different. I learnt a lot about Javascript, HTML and CSS with this project.

The Process
I found Javascript quite challenging, having only been using it for two weeks. I found writing the logic behind the game quite complicated. 

I also learnt to do pseudo code in order to help planing the project before jumping into it.

My really enjoyed styling the project, I used a giff from giphy and I just kep a nice white border arround it in order to keep it neat and tidy.

The audio is plain old elevator music which is just a simple touch to make the app pleasent and fun to play on.

There are a few improvements I would like to go back and fix when I become a little more confident with Javascript, I would like to add more logic to the game so players can loose, gain points and get more challenging lyrics so the game can become more complicated for the player. I feel that I learned a lot about Javascript, CSS and HTML by building this project.
